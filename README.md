# android-streetview-motion

This example application uses hardware sensors to control a Google Maps StreetView's perspective.

## Setup

It is required to add a Google Maps API key into file `local.properties` as `MAPS_API_KEY=...`.

Hint: disabling the device's screen auto-rotation is being recommended,<br/>
else the screen will rotate, when tilting the device to a steep angle.
